# Daque Library

Daque is development team formed in mid-2018. Its main project, [ViaRE] is a procedurally generated videogame focused in the simulation of human evolution and interaction.

`libdaque` is the most important library used in [ViaRE],  and contains more useful modules to ease game development. It is highly mathematics-focused.

`libdaque` handles graphic ports, mathematic operations for 3D visualization, and geometric and graphical utilities, like mesh generation.

Some extra functions in mind, but not ready at [current version] are approximation and interpolation of curves, thiessen polygons, morphology and hydrology simulations, population dynamics, social network theory, and many more things that could (and will) be used in [ViaRE].

There's not 1.0.0 version yet.
