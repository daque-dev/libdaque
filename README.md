# Daque Library

Daque is development team formed in mid-2018. Its main project, [ViaRE](https://gitlab.com/daque/viare) is a procedurally generated videogame focused in the simulation of human evolution and interaction.

`libdaque` is the library used for ViaRE, and contains more useful modules to ease game development. It is highly mathematics-focused.

`libdaque` will handle graphic ports, mathematic operations for 3D Visualization, and some helpful utilities.

There's not 1.0.0 version yet.
